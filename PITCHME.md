## Python 101
### Introduction to Python @Cegeka

## Introduction

- Short course  |
- Very hands-on, project in every course  |
- Repetition, repetition, repetition  |

Note:
This will be a short course, that covers the main features of python.
We won't go into details, but we want you to get a solid understanding
of the basics and where to look if you have questions (yes, you will
become an expert python googler).

In programming, practice is better than theory, so in every course
we'll have a hands-on project.

To learn something, you need to repeat it enough times that it becomes
a part of your thought. This is why over the course we will use use
the same concepts again and again in different contexts.

## Rules

- Interactive course, you can ask me any question at any time  |
- No question is a dumb question  |

Note:
Since this is a hands on course, it's meant to be interactive.
Ask me any question at any time.
I mean it, no question is a dumb question

## Project - Hashtag

- Simple project
- We'll add more features to every course
- Reads a list of hashtags and messages and publishes them to twitter
using the twitter API

---

- Steps:
  - Start with a hardcoded list and print it in the terminal (Course 1)
  - Read the input from excel and use the twitter API (Course 2)
  - Create a web server that does this action when requested (Course 3)

In the last course we'll have a hackaton with your own ideas.
